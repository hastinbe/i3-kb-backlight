### Standalone

This script does not require any particular desktop environment and can be used as a standalone script.

#### Command-line options
```bash
Usage: ./brightness [<options>] <command> [<args>]
Control keyboard backlight brightness.

Commands:
  increase <value>      increase brightness
  decrease <value>      decrease brightness
  notifications         show available notification methods
  help                  display help

Options:
  -e <expires>          expiration time of notifications in ms
  -i <icon>             name of keyboard brightness icon
  -n                    enable notifications
  -N <method>           notification method (default: libnotify)
  -p                    enable progress bar
  -h                    display help

### Examples

# Notifications using herbe, progress bar
./brightness -np -N herbe increase

# Notifications using libnotify with notify-send, custom icon name, expiration time of 2.5 seconds
./brightness -n -i keyboard-brightness -e 2500 increase

# Notifications using libnotify with dunstify, custom symbolic icon, custom dunstify path
env DUNSTIFY_PATH=/path/to/dunst/ ./brightness -npy -i keyboard-brightness-symbolic increase

# Notifications using XOSD
./brightness -n -N xosd increase
```

## Migrating

### Version 1.x to 2.x

Version 2 introduces commands which makes it incompatible with previous versions. Your command-line usage and/or configured hotkeys need to be updated to reflect this.

| Change | v1 | v2 |
| ------ | -- | -- |
| `-d` is now the `decrease` command | `brightness -d 1` | `brightness decrease` |
| `-i` is now the `increase` command | `brightness -i 1` | `brightness increase` |
